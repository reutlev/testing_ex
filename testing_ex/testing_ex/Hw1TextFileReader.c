/* 
This file contains the implementation of the Text File Reader module. 
See TextFileReader.h for general details and usage.

Implementation details: 
1. The content of the text file is copied into dynamic memory.
2. A parser recognizes words as sequences that are separated by whitespaces.
3. An '\0' symbol is inserted at the end of each word, making it possible to
   use it as a string.
4. A structure of pointers to word-starts and to line-start is created,
   making it possible to access each word using array-like indexing (the
   structure is similar to the one in the module Dynamic2DIntArr ).
5. Before handing over the object to the user, all data structures are made
   const. This prevents the user from inadvertently destroying the internal 
   structure. This is equivalent to giving the user read-only access to the 
   contents of the text file.
   
This File was written as part of HW assignment 2 in the course "Introduction
To Systems Programming" at Tel-Aviv University's School of Electrical 
Engineering, Winter 2011, by Amnon Drory.
